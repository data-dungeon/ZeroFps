Mistlands - Manual: Editor
********************************************************************************
This document describes how to use the editor (zeroed.exe) in Mistlands.

### How to connect with the editor
Type "connect ipnumber" in the console. All editor functions doens't work over 
the network yet. When connected to a server, the world is saved when the server
quits the application from the console. Typing save in the editor won't save 
the world.

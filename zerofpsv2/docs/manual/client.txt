Mistlands - Manual: Client
********************************************************************************

### Before you can play
You need a server to connect to. All servers started will be listed when you try to
connect. If your unlucky however, no server is started. You can easily start one yourself
by starting up mistserver.

### How to connect to the server
Start the mistclient application.
There are then two ways of connecting to a server. The fastest one is doing it 
from the consol by typing connect ipnummer loginname password, ex. connect 
192.168.0.100 MyName MyPassword in the console. The other way is using the gui.
Press start and then the Add button to add a new server. Then select a server 
from the list and press connect. Now you will be told to enter a playername and 
a password. When you press Ok after typing both name and password, the client 
should connect to the chosen server. The password you enter is the userpassword
for your character. The password is saved the first time you enter the server, 
and the second time you enter you must chose the same password.

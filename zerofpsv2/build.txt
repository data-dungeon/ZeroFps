Mistlands - Build.
********************************************************************************

This is a guide of what is needed to install the ZeroFps engine for 
development. 

### What applications do i need.
You need to have a OS and compiler that ZeroFps supports. The ones the 
developers use are:

	* Windows:	VC++ .NET 2003.
	* Linux:	GCC 3.4
	
### Get Source
The source code for a snapshot is found in src.rar. Unpack this to /src. You can
also checkout the src from https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=55045, module 
ZeroFpsV2. To run it also need some datafiles but the are part of the snapshot 
so you already have them :).
	
### Download all libs you need.

    files in /include.
		/include		lua

Mistlands - Install Guide.
********************************************************************************

How to i install the game:
Unpack the file that contain the snapshot and put it in a path without any 
spaces in the name. C:\games\mistland would work fine. Putting it on the window 
desktop don't work.

How do i run the game:
Start mistserver found in the bin dir and then start mistclient also in the bin
dir. Select connect in mistclient, local server and then join. Set any loginname,
password and remember it to next time you connect. Create a new characters, 
give him a name and the click play to start.

Linux:
Note - dont try to run the .bin files directly. Instead you shuld run the 
shellscripts run*.sh like runmistserver.sh otherwise it wont find all librarys.

some external librarys are included in "bin/linux_stuff". If you are missing any 
librarys you could possible just copy them from "bin/linux_stuff/" to 
"bin/" .

Ok ive been thinking about this for a while since it has been worrying me. Alot of the programmers I talk to over the internet are pretty inteligent, they get A's in most of their subjects, and a strong in subjects like maths. And can genrally learn/understand things easier and faster. I was wondering if programmers like ME, who arent that intelligent..a little bit above average but doesnt stand out. Can make it into the buisness. For example, my maths skills were worrying me when I got a C in my exams, I didnt think I could get any higher, however I then got a B, and I worked quite hard. Now i know for alot of people they dont have to work hard to get higher grades, a friend at school got straight A's and didnt revise at all..OK ill stop chatting on now. But my main question is, can I still make it into the buissness if im not greatly intelligent? I took an IQ test and got 98, which Isnt very good

Programming is programming. I think if you have a
passion for programming you can succede regardless
of any outside influences, such as some bs iq exam.

As somebody else mentioned, the passion and love for
programming, is what creates good programmers. Getting
an 'A' in calculus is pretty much completely unrelated.

Although I think it might happen that a fair number
of people who do well in their math classes do well
because they have a passion for math, and many people
who have a passion for computer science also have a
passion for math. So it leads to the natural, though
possibly incorrect, assumption that a "good" programmer
will make "good" grades in a given class.

Although I'm in the minority. I don't even believe
in the concept of intelligence. All people are relatively
equal. The only thing that seperates people is motivation.

Take the "chess geniuses". 12 year old children who can
beat world class adults. What people often fail to 
mention is that those 12 year olds have been playing
8 hours a day since they were 4, and often have fathers
who make the child believe that chess is their only
reason to live.

No genius, just obsesession and motivation.
